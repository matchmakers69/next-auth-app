## 1. What is Hydration in Next.js

<br />

### Hydration process steps in Next.js

<br />

- **Initially page is rendered on server - SSR**
- **Fully rendered HTML is sent to the browser**
- **React takes over** - attaching event listeners and making page interactive.

### Step-by-Step Hydration Process

<br />

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR) - Initial Render

<br />- **Serves fetches data, generates HTML and sends it to the browser** -{" "}

```js
export const TIMEOUT_TIME = 1000000;
```

or this?

```js
export const TIMEOUT_TIME = 100_000;
```

Could you tell there was a missing zero in the second example?

## 3. Comments

Your code can be the most beautiful thing in the world. I still don't want to have to read it all
character by character to understand what it does or _why_ it does it.

I like to leave comments at the top of my files (which are often named after the feature they're implementing) explaining the high-level overview of the file.
