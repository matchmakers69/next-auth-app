#### Concept of a **CI/CD** workflow using Jenkins, AWS CodeCommit, and automated testing.

<br />

**Branching Strategy**

- **Master** - Production-ready code. No direct merges allowed.
- **Feature** - Code that is being developed. **Feature branches** are deployed to
  staging environments where testers validate the new features and run tests.

<br />

**Feature branches**

- Code reviews happens before merging to ensure quality.
- Jenkins is used to run CRUD operations on feature branches.
- **Automate CI/CD Validation** - AWS CodePipeline is used to automate the CI/CD process.
  AWS CodePipeline runs Sonar Cloud, VRTs on feature branches. If issues are found, the branch can be fixed before merging.

  <br />

  **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)**

  - **Continuous Integration** - Developers push code to feature branches. AWS CodePipeline runs tests and deploys the code to staging.
  - **Continuous Deployment** - Once the feature branch is validated, it is merged to master. AWS CodePipeline deploys the code to production.

<br />

**CI process**

- **Push to feature branch** - AWS CodePipeline starts to automate the **CI/CD** process.
- **VRTs** - Visual Regression Tests are run.

<br />

**CD process**

- **Deploy to Staging** - If all checks pass, AWS CodePipeline automatically deploys the application to staging or production environments.
- **Manual Testing** - Testers validate the new features.
- **Merge to Master** - Once the feature branch is validated, it is merged to master.
