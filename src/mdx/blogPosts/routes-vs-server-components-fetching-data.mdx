## Fetch Inside Server Components When:

<br />

### 1. Data does not change Frequently (or changes per deployment)

- **Ideal for static or semi-static content such as**: Product pages, Blog posts, documentation

<br />

```js
export default async function ProductPage() {
  const products = await db.product.findMany();
  return <ProductList products={products} />;
}
```

<br />

### 2. SEO Benefits (SSR/SSG) & Faster Load

### 3. Better performance - Client API calls reduced

### 4. Data can be cached - server components can cache requests automatically

<br />
<br />

## Use API routes when:

<br />

### 1. Data changes very often

### 2. Data changes very often

### 3. Need authentication (protected API requests)

### 4. Need to handle business logic before returning data i.e data transformation before data is sent to the front expanded

### 5. Use API routes for creating, updating or deleting resources

<br />

- **If the data depends on authentication, it's better to use API route**.

  <br />
  **Example:**
  <br />

- A personalized dashboard
- A user's order history

<br />

Fetching in Server Component would not work well because:

<br />

**Next.js Server Components run before knowing the user's session (unless using middleware)**
